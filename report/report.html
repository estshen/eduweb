        Report: Large Coursework

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>
            People talk more often about it these days during COVID, we all miss that time when we could be outside with freedom.
            Whether it is a trip, a book, an exhibition, or a shop, they convey the beauty in our lives. 
            It seems increasingly important to have a safe place to share stories where people discover the diversity in this world during
            such a difficult time. Therefore, I made Lite, a website consisting of resources, blog posts, insights, and more.
            I hope that through the little words and images of my website, people can feel the existence of beauty in this world again.</p> 

        <h3>Type of structure</h3>
        <p>I chose to structure the website into 5 sections, with each section having its own separate page. 
            The home page is more general, giving users an idea of my website. The Cities Page consists of articles of travellers and locals' story 
            in different parts of the world. The Art Page focuses on collections from indie artists. The Food Page is dedicated to restaurants and reviews from
            customers. The About Page shows information about our team, our values, and ways people could reach us.
        </p>
        

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I am first inspired by artist Alex Katz's work "Bella", I designed the colour scheme of my website because I liked the khaki used in his work.
        </li>

        <li>
            Second, I am inspired by a WeChat official account "24Hours". They are a lifestyle platform with content related to travelling, art, and food.
            They mentioned a quote by Khalil Gibran, “We live only to discover beauty. All else is a form of waiting”, which inspired me to
            create an online platform where people could share their insights about the beauty of life in different aspects of our 
            daily life.

        </li>

        <li>
            Lastly, I am inspired by a developer Anjolaoluwa Adebayo-Oyetoro, who wrote elaborate tutorials on using flexbox in CSS to make responsive photo galleries,
            which guided me a lot while coding my photo galleries and carousels for my website. 
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I carefully picked colour schemes for my website, and used colours with a strong contrast with each other so that users can easily read the texts. I also used Contrast Checker to get 
            an idea of whether my colour combination works.
        </li>
        <li>I labelled my sections with clarity by using semantic tags or classes, which makes it easy for users to know the structure of each page.</li>
        <li>I used semantic tags and added alt texts to all of my img tags. The alt texts explicitly describe what's on the picture, which makes it more friendly to users with 
            visual impairment.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I made sure to keep my navigations simple and concise. All the links to different pages look the same in style and are easy to find at the top right of my site.</li>
        <li>My site is responsive and supports desktop and mobile devices. I added @media at the end of every CSS stylesheets and made sure the page adjusts flexibly to different screen width and sizes.</li>
        <li>I kept learnability in mind when coding the interfaces. I used different icons like “+” signs, left and right arrows to guide users to click to expand accordions, or click to see the next carousel card. And I made sure the cursor change styles when interacting with different sections, for example, the cursor turns to a pointer when it hovers over links.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First, I had to learn to use separate stylesheets for my website. I initially put all the CSS code in one stylesheet, 
            but then found out that would be hard to navigate as my code got longer and longer. So I had to separate them and decide
            which parts should be left in the global sheet and which parts could be moved to their individual sheets. And I carefully rewrote 
            the sitemap a few times to make sure the section names do not conflict with each other while separating the CSS files.
        </li>
        <li>In addition, I learned to use extensions and javascript libraries to help my site achieve a more pleasant user experience.
            I learned to link font awesome icons, google fonts, owl carousels, AOS scroll library and jquery to my work. 
            I carefully read instructions of these above-mentioned tools and were able to add aesthetic effects, icons and fonts thanks to them.
            But there were also glitches when implementing owl carousels, which didn't agree with my banner section at first, and I had to edit 
            its style, add padding and translate its position to make it function well. 
        </li>
        <li>What's more, I became more familiar with GitHub as I find it useful in version control. I created multiple branches to test new functions
            that I wanted to add to a certain section, and if it failed, I would not lose the original version, and if it worked, I could easily create
            pull requests and merge it with the main branch. 

        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Evaluation I: What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>
    <p>
        I believe the design and colour scheme of my site worked well.
        I was able to write semantic code well with HTML to make the code readable, so that others, including me, will be able to understand the code. 
        I was also able to employ CSS grids when designing the framework of my site.
        As well as in making the site responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.

        In addition, I correctly linked extensions like google fonts, font awesome icons, Owl Carousel 2, and Animate On Scroll Library to make my site more versatile.
        
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation II: What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
        another time?</h2>
    <p>
        I used separate stylesheets for different pages, and one global stylesheet for all of them. 
        But there are still a few elements that could be simplified into the global stylesheet instead of repeating in different ".css" files. 
        For example, I will try to create variables for font family and colours schemes next time to achieve a consistent design, instead of manually change all the fonts and colours every time I make amendments for the fonts and colour scheme.
    </p>


    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
        When designing the colour scheme, I referred to Coolers.com. 
        I implemented Google Fonts for all the fonts used on my website as well.
        Besides, Font Awesome helped make my website look modern with its stylish icons.
        What's more, js libraries like Owl Carousel 2 and Animate On Scroll Library created animations for my site.
        I also linked jquery to save time in coding javascript.
        Apart from that, I used copyright-free photos from pexels.com.
